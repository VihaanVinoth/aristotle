## Why I made Aristotle CSS
I made this as a boilerplate for simple & lightweight web design, with the power of classes and colors.

## Perks
- Zero Javascript 
- Pure Vanilla CSS 
- Easy to extend 
- Selection of colors and classes 🎨

# How I created this project
I was inspired by various other CSS frameworks by their stylish attributes and designs, and decided to create something light. 

# How to visit project? 
I might host the demo soon, but for now, you can ```git clone``` in these steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/VihaanVinoth/aristotle.git
cd aristotle
mv aristotle.css [YOUR/FILE/PATH] (or simply drag into your folder)
```
...in your ```index.html```:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="aristotle.css">
```

...and you're done!

## Example

<img style="-webkit-user-drag: none;" draggable="false" width="629" height="307" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-08 at 11 44 30 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ce2f26c-6bb5-478f-8887-64e574bad46d" />

## Extras
If you want, you can also link your ```style.css```, but in reference to ```aristotle.css```, type ```!important``` next to the CSS property, like this:

```
color: red !important;
```
